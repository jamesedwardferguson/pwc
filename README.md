Code test for PWC

This is my code test for the following brief:

The brief is;
___________________

You have been given this form design (attached/below) by UX and need to code a quick prototype. The code must be your own. You cannot use any third party libraries other than jQuery or angular. You do not need to be pixel perfect or colour perfect but should capture the essence of the design.

Your end code needs to be standalone and not require compilation or access to the internet to run.

Upload your code to github and provide us a link.

How it will be judged: choice of semantics, css techniques, javascript best practices and overall code quality.

You will have up to 1 week to complete the challenge.

I tried to make this code as responsive as I could for desktop, mobile and tablet.
